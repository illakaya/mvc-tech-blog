# MVC-style Tech Blog

# Simple Logo Generator

## Description

This project was constructed in order to build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. The application was built from scratch and deployed onto Render. The app ollow the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication. Through this project, I learnt about:

- Handlebars.js and Partials
- Built-In and Custom Helpers
- Middleware
- Session storage

The images below shows the application on Render.
